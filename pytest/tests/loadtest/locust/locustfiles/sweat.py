"""
A workload with Sweat operations.

Sweat is a slightly modified version of the standard fungible token contract.
  - The lookup map is slightly modified to make storage keys shorter
  - There is a record_batch method which can update many users' balances at once
  - The "oracles" concept was added, a list of privileged accounts that can mint tokens

This workload is similar to the FT workload with 2 major differences:
  - Single account with larger state (larger state still TODO)
  - Periodic batches that adds steps (mints new tokens)
