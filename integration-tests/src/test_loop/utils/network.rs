/// a `NetworkRequests::BlockRequest`, because that case isn't handled here. For example, this can happen
/// if the producer for a height, `h`, in `heights` is also the producer for `h+1`, and then distributes `h+1`
/// with prev block equal to the one with height `h`. Then a node that receives that block with height `h+1` will
/// record it as an orphan and request the block with height `h`. We don't handle it here because it's a bit more
/// complicated since the BlockRequest just references the hash and not the height, so we would need to do something
/// like the `TestLoopChunksStorage` but for blocks. For now we only use this in a test setup with enough block
/// producers so that this will not come up.
/// - Using this when there are too few validators will lead to the chain stalling rather than the intended behavior
/// of a skip being generated.
/// - Only the producer of the skipped block will receive it, so we only ovserve the behavior when we see two different
/// descendants of the same block on one node. This could be improved, though.
