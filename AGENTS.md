## Rust
- Prefer `use` declarations over fully qualified paths.
- Don't capitalize string literal messages in logs, errors, `Option::expect`, `panic!`, etc.

## Pull Requests
- Always follow the Pull Requests instructions from `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Use bullet-point description for PRs that highlight key changes, motivations, testing, and important context.
- Don't include a separate test plan section (or similar multi-section descriptions).
- Don't include "generated by AI" or similar footers.

## Protocol Schema Check
- Do NOT run the protocol schema check unless explicitly asked. It is expensive.
- When asked to update the schema, first read `tools/protocol-schema-check/README.md`, then follow its instructions exactly. Do NOT guess the command.

## Testing
- When running tests, use `--features test_features`.

## Formatting
- Run `cargo fmt` after making changes. It's cheap.

## Clippy
- Only run clippy prior to making a commit. It is somewhat expensive.

## OpenAPI Spec
- Do NOT update the OpenAPI spec unless explicitly asked.
- When asked, follow the `openapi-spec` recipe in the `Justfile`.

## Consensus
- For high-level documentation on the consensus protocol, see `docs/ChainSpec/Consensus.md`.
- Doomslug is implemented in `chain/chain/src/doomslug.rs`.

## Block Processing
- Entry point: `Chain::start_process_block_async` in `chain/chain/src/chain.rs`.
- Blocks whose parent is unknown are stored in the orphan pool and processed when the parent arrives.
- Synchronous preprocessing in `preprocess_block` validates in this order: block signature → header → block body → chunk headers → chunk endorsements (>2/3 stake per chunk for non-SPICE) → missing chunks check.
- After validation, chunk application runs asynchronously on a rayon thread pool; postprocessing saves state and updates head.
- Optimistic blocks allow chunk application to start before the full block arrives; cached results are reused during normal block processing. See `docs/architecture/how/optimistic_block.md`. Disabled for SPICE.
- See `docs/ChainSpec/BlockProcessing.md` for the spec and `docs/ChainSpec/Consensus.md` for Doomslug finality.
