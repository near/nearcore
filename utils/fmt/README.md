# Custom formatting for the nearcore code base.

This crate is a lightweight assembly of wrapper types that we use to pretty
print values.

Keep dependencies to an absolute minimum, since this crate is a dependency of
`near-primitives` which in turn is used by many near related crates inside and
outside the nearcore repository.
