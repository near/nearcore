# Rust ðŸ¦€

This short chapter collects various useful general resources about the Rust
programming language. If you are already familiar with Rust, skip this
chapter. Otherwise, this chapter is for you!

## Getting Help

Rust community actively encourages beginners to ask questions, take advantage of that!

We have a dedicated stream for Rust questions on our Zulip: [Rust
ðŸ¦€](https://near.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/300659-Rust-.F0.9F.A6.80).

There's a general Rust forum at <https://users.rust-lang.org>.

For a more interactive chat, take a look at Discord:

## Reference Material

Rust is _very_ well documented. It's possible to learn the whole language and
most of the idioms by just reading the official docs. Starting points are

* [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (any resemblance to "Guide to
  Nearcore Development" is purely coincidental)
* [Standard Library API](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/)

Alternatives are:

* [Programming
  Rust](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Rust-Fast-Systems-Development/dp/1491927283)
  is an alternative book that moves a bit faster.
* [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) is a great
  resource for learning by doing.

Rust has some great tooling, which is also documented:

* [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), the build system. Worth at least skimming through!
* For IDE support, see [IntelliJ Rust](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/) if you
  like JetBrains products or
  [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html) if you use any
  other editor (fun fact: NEAR was one of the sponsors of rust-analyzer!).
* [Rustup](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/) manages versions of Rust
  itself. It's unobtrusive, so feel free to skip this.

## Cheat Sheet

This is a thing in its category, do check it out:

## Language Mastery

* [Rust for Rustaceans](https://nostarch.com/rust-rustaceans) â€” the book to read
  after "The Book".
* [Tokio docs](https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial) explain asynchronous programming
  in Rust (async/await).
* [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/about.html)
  codify rules for idiomatic Rust APIs. Note that guidelines apply to _semver
  surface_ of libraries, and most of the code in nearcore is not on the semver
  boundary. Still, a lot of insight there!
* [Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/) explains `unsafe`. (any
  resemblance to <https://nomicon.io> is purely coincidental)
