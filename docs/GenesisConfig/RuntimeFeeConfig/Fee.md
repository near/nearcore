# Fee

Costs associated with an object that can only be sent over the network (and executed by the receiver).

## send_sir

Fee for sending an object from the sender to itself, guaranteeing that it does not leave (SIR = signer is receiver, which guarantees the receipt is local).

## send_not_sir

Fee for sending an object potentially across the shards.

## execution

Fee for executing the object.
