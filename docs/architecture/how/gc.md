# Garbage Collection

This document covers the basics of Chain garbage collection.

Currently we run garbage collection only in non-archival nodes,  to keep the
size of the storage under control. Therefore, we remove blocks, chunks and state
that is â€˜oldâ€™ enough  - which in current configuration means 5 epochs ago.

We run a single â€˜roundâ€™ of GC after a new block is accepted to the chain - and
in order not to delay the chain too much, we make sure that each round removes
at most 2 blocks from the chain.

## How it works:

Imagine the following chain (with 2 forks)

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/195649805-e7997192-be3a-4bf0-992d-d35b2ad80847.png)

In the pictures below, letâ€™s assume that epoch length is 5 and we keep only 3
epochs (rather than 5 that is currently set in production) - otherwise the image
becomes too large ðŸ˜‰.

If head is in the middle of the epoch, the `gc_stop` will be set to the first
block of epoch T-2, and `tail` & `fork_tail` will be sitting at the last block of
epoch T-3.

(and no GC is happening in this round - as tail is next to `gc_stop`).

Next block was accepted on the chain (head jumped ahead), but still no GC
happening in this round:

Now interesting things will start happening once head â€˜crossesâ€™ over to the
next epoch.

First, the `gc_stop` will jump to the beginning of the next epoch.

Then weâ€™ll start the GC of the forks: by first moving the `fork_tail` to match
the `gc_stop` and going backwards from there.

It will start removing all the blocks that donâ€™t have a successor (a.k.a the tip
of the fork). And then it will proceed to lower height.

Will keep going until it â€˜hitsâ€™ the tail.

In order not to do too much in one go, weâ€™d only remove up to 2 block in each
run  (that happens after each head update).

Now, the forks are gone, so we can proceed with GCing of the blocks from
the canonical chain:

Same as before, weâ€™d remove up to 2 blocks in each run:

Until we catch up to the `gc_stop`.
