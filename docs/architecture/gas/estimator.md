# Runtime Parameter Estimator

The runtime parameter estimator is a byzantine benchmarking suite. Byzantine
benchmarking is not really commonly used term but I feel it describes it quite
well. It measures the performance assuming that up to a third of validators and
all users collude to make the system as slow as possible.

This benchmarking suite is used check that the gas parameters defined in the
protocol are correct. Correct in this context means, a chunk filled with 1 Pgas
will take at most 1 second to be applied. Or more generally, per 1 Tgas of
execution, we spend no more than 1ms wall-clock time. 

For now, nearcore timing is the only one that matters. Things will become more
complicated once there are multiple client implementations. But knowing that
nearcore can serve requests fast enough proofs that it is possible to be at
least as fast. However, we should be careful to not couple costs too tightly
with the specific implementation of nearcore to allow for innovation in new
clients.

The estimator code is part of the nearcore repository in the directory
[runtime/runtime-params-estimator](https://github.com/near/nearcore/tree/master/runtime/runtime-params-estimator).

## Running the Estimator

Type this in your console to quickly run estimations on a couple of action costs.

```bash
cargo run -p runtime-params-estimator --features required -- \
    --accounts-num 20000 --additional-accounts-num 20000 \
    --iters 3 --warmup-iters 1 --metric time \
    --costs=ActionReceiptCreation,ActionTransfer,ActionCreateAccount,ActionFunctionCallBase
```

You should get an output like this.

```

```

This shows how much gas a parameter should cost to satisfy the 1ms = 1Tgas rule.
It also shows how much time that corresponds to and how long it took to compute
each of the estimations.

Note that the above does not produce very accurate results and it can have high
variance as well. It runs an unoptimized binary, the state is small, and the
metric used is wall-clock time which is always prone to variance in hardware and
can be affected by other processes currently running on your system.

Once your estimation code is ready, it is better to run it with a larger state
and an optimized binary.

```bash
cargo run --release -p runtime-params-estimator --features required -- \
    --accounts-num 20000 --additional-accounts-num 2000000 \
    --iters 3 --warmup-iters 1 --metric time \
    --costs=ActionReceiptCreation,ActionTransfer,ActionCreateAccount,ActionFunctionCallBase
```

You might also want to run a hardware-agnostic estimation using the following
command. It uses `docker` and `qemu` under the hood, so it will be quite a bit
slower. You will need to install `docker` to run this command.


```bash
cargo run --release -p runtime-params-estimator --features required -- \
    --accounts-num 20000 --additional-accounts-num 2000000 \
    --iters 3 --warmup-iters 1 --metric icount --docker --full \
    --costs=ActionReceiptCreation,ActionTransfer,ActionCreateAccount,ActionFunctionCallBase
```

Note how the output looks a bit different now. The `i`, `r` and `w` values show
instruction count, read IO bytes, and write IO bytes respectively. The IO byte
count is known to be inaccurate.

The difference between the metrics will be discussed in the
section on [Estimation Metrics](#estimation-metrics).

You should now be all setup for running estimations on your local machine. Also
check `cargo run -p runtime-params-estimator --features required -- --help` for
the list of available options.

## From Estimations to Parameter Values

To calculate the final gas parameter values, there is more to be done than just
running a single command. After all, these parameters are part of the protocol
specification. They cannot be changed easily. And setting them to a wrong value
can cause severe system instability.

Our current strategy is to run estimations
with two different metrics and do so on standardized cloud hardware. The output
is then sanity checked manually by several people. Based on that, the final gas
parameter value is determined. Usually it will be the higher output of the two
metrics rounded up. More details on the process will be added to this document
in due time.

## Code Structure
The estimator contains a binary and a library module. The
[main.rs](https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/e40863c9ba61a0de140c869583b2113358605771/runtime/runtime-params-estimator/src/main.rs)
contains the CLI arguments parsing code and logic to fill the test database.

The interesting code lives in
[lib.rs](https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/e40863c9ba61a0de140c869583b2113358605771/runtime/runtime-params-estimator/src/lib.rs)
and its submodules. The comments on the top of that file provide a
high-level overview of how estimations work. More details on specific
estimations are available as comments on the enum variants of `Cost` in
[costs.rs](https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/e40863c9ba61a0de140c869583b2113358605771/runtime/runtime-params-estimator/src/cost.rs#L9).

If you roughly understand the three files above, you already have a great
overview around the estimator.
[estimator_context.rs](https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/e40863c9ba61a0de140c869583b2113358605771/runtime/runtime-params-estimator/src/estimator_context.rs)
is another central file. A full estimation run creates a single
`EstimatorContext`. Each individual estimation will use it to spawn a new
`Testbed` with a fresh database that contains the same data as setup in the
estimator context.

Most estimations fill blocks with transactions to be executed and hands them to
`Testbed::measure_blocks`. To allow for easy repetitions, the block is usually
filled by an instance of the
[`TransactionBuilder`](https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/e40863c9ba61a0de140c869583b2113358605771/runtime/runtime-params-estimator/src/transaction_builder.rs),
which can be retrieved from a testbed.

But even filling blocks with transactions becomes repetitive since many
parameters are estimated similarly.
[utils.rs](https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/master/runtime/runtime-params-estimator/src/utils.rs)
has a collection of helpful functions that let you write estimations very
quickly.
