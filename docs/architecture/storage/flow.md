# Flow

Here we present the flow of a single read or write request from the transaction runtime
all the way to the OS. As you can see, there are many layers of read-caching and
write-buffering involved.

Blue arrow means a call triggered by read.

Red arrow means a call triggered by write.

Black arrow means a non-trivial data dependency. For example:
* Nodes which are read on TrieStorage go to TrieRecorder to generate proof, so they
are connected with black arrow.
* Memtrie lookup needs current state of accounting cache to compute costs. When
query completes, accounting cache is updated with memtrie nodes. So they are connected
with bidirectional black arrow.
