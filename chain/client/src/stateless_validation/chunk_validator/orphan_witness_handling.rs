//! This module contains the logic of handling orphaned chunk state witnesses.
//! To process a ChunkStateWitness we need its previous block, but sometimes
//! the witness shows up before the previous block is available, so it can't be
//! processed immediately. In such cases the witness becomes an orphaned witness
//! and it's kept in the pool until the required block arrives. Once the block
//! arrives, all witnesses that were waiting for it can be processed.
