# Core Developer Documentation

The documentation within this folder affects mostly the **NEAR Protocol Core Team**, Core-Collaborators (Contributors with access to project resources) and Core-Contributors.

The term "Core" implies that those developer know what they are doing, even if it is "deep in the systems core".

## Writing Documentation

Documentation must be kept minimal. If you describe something too much, then it's an indicator that it must be simplified or automated.

Automation should be provided either within cross-platform tools, or cross-platform scripting (usually node.js or python)

Remember that you address capable (core-) developers, it is not necessary to describe things much. Let cli-commands or code talk, go straight to the point. Add now and then some link to high-quality documentation.
