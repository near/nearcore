//! Changes trie related structures and functions.
//!
//! Changes trie is a trie built of { storage key => extrinsiscs } pairs
//! at the end of each block. For every changed storage key it contains
//! a pair, mapping key to the set of extrinsics where it has been changed.
//!
//! Optionally, every N blocks, additional level1-digest nodes are appended
//! to the changes trie, containing pairs { storage key => blocks }. For every
//! storage key that has been changed in PREVIOUS N-1 blocks (except for genesis
//! block) it contains a pair, mapping this key to the set of blocks where it
//! has been changed.
//!
//! Optionally, every N^digest_level (where digest_level > 1) blocks, additional
//! digest_level digest is created. It is built out of pairs { storage key => digest
//! block }, containing entries for every storage key that has been changed in
//! the last N*digest_level-1 blocks (except for genesis block), mapping these keys
//! to the set of lower-level digest blocks.
//!
//! Changes trie only contains the top level storage changes. Sub-level changes
//! are propogated through its storage root on the top level storage.
