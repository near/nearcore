//! Contains flat storage optimization logic.
//!
//! FlatStorage is created as an additional representation of the state alongside with Tries.
//! It simply stores a mapping from all key value pairs stored in our Tries (leaves of the trie)
//! It is used for fast key value look up in the state. Reading a single key/value in trie
//! requires traversing the trie from the root, loading many nodes from the database. In flat storage,
//! we store a mapping from keys to value references so that key value lookup will only require two
//! db accesses - one to get value reference, one to get the value itself. In fact, in the case of small
//! values, flat storage only needs one read, because value will be stored in the mapping instead of
//! value ref.
//!
//! The main challenge in the flat storage implementation is that we need to able to handle forks,
//! so the flat storage API must support key value lookups for different blocks.
//! To achieve that, we store the key value pairs of the state on a block (head of the flat storage)
//! on disk and also store the change deltas for some other blocks in memory. With these deltas,
//! we can perform lookups for the other blocks. See comments in `FlatStorageState` to see
//! which block should be the head of flat storage and which other blocks do flat storage support.
//!
//! This file contains the implementation of FlatStorage. It has three essential structs.
//!
//! `FlatState`: this provides an interface to get value or value references from flat storage. This
//!              is the struct that will be stored as part of Trie. All trie reads will be directed
//!              to the flat state.
//! `FlatStateFactory`: this is to construct flat state.
//! `FlatStorageState`: this stores some information about the state of the flat storage itself,
//!                     for example, all block deltas that are stored in flat storage and a representation
//!                     of the chain formed by these blocks (because we can't access ChainStore
//!                     inside flat storage).
