//! This is a framework to test async code in a way that is versatile, deterministic,
//! easy-to-setup, and easy-to-debug.
//!
//! The primary concept here is an event loop that the test framework controls. The
//! event loop acts as a central hub for all messages, including Actix messages,
//! network messages, timers, etc. Business logic is only executed as a response to
//! such events.
//!
//! This brings several major benefits:
//!  - Ease of setup:
//!     - There is no need to set up mock objects that implement some
//!       message sender interface, instead, the test loop provides a sender object that
//!       can be used to send messages to the event loop. For example, suppose we were
//!       to make a Client whose constructor requires a shards_manager adapter; instead
//!       of having to make a mock for the shards_manager adapter, we can simply register
//!       the shards_manager actor with testloop and pass in its sender.
//!     - Compared to writing synchronous tests, there is no need to manually deliver
//!       network messages or handle actix messages at certain points of the test. Instead,
//!       the event loop will invoke the appropriate event handlers whenever there is any
//!       event remaining in the event loop. This ensures that no messages are ever missed.
//!     - Test setup code can be modular and reusable, because the test specification
//!       consists entirely of registering the data and actors. Rather than passing a giant
//!       callback into a giant setup(...) function to customize one part of a huge
//!       integration test, we can flexibly compose specific modules with event handlers.
//!       For example, we may add an event handler to route all ShardsManager-related network
//!       messages reliably, and at the same time another event handler to drop 50% of Block
//!       network messages. Also, we can use an event handler as long as it is relevant for a
//!       test (i.e. a ForwardShardsManagerRequest event handler can be used as long as the
//!       test involves ShardsManagers), regardless of the exact architecture of the test.
//!
//!  - Debuggability:
//!     - Because ALL execution is in response of events, the whole test can be cleanly
//!       segmented into the response to each event. The framework automatically outputs
//!       a log message at the beginning of each event execution, so that the log output
//!       can be loaded into a visualizer to show the exact sequence of events, their
//!       relationship, the exact contents of the event messages, and the log output
//!       during the handling of each event. This is especially useful when debugging
//!       multi-instance tests.
//!
//!  - Determinism:
//!     - Many tests, especially those that involve multiple instances, are most easily
//!       written by spawning actual actors and threads. This however makes the tests
//!       inherently asynchronous and may be more flaky.
//!     - The test loop framework also provides a synchronous and deterministic way to
//!       invoke timers without waiting for the actual duration. This makes tests run
//!       much faster than asynchronous tests.
//!
//!  - Versatilty:
//!     - A test can be constructed with any combination of components. The framework does
//!       not dictate what components should exist, or how many instances there should be.
//!       This allows for both small and focused tests, and large multi-instance tests.
//!     - Timed tests can be written to check the theoretical performance of certain tasks,
//!       such as distributing chunks to other nodes within X milliseconds provided that
//!       network messages have a 10ms delay.
//!     - The framework does not require major migrations to existing code, e.g. it is
//!       compatible with the Actix framework and futures.
//!
//! A note on the order of execution of the events: all events that are due at the same
//! timestamp are executed in FIFO order. For example, if the events are emitted in the
//! following order: (A due 100ms), (B due 0ms), (C due 200ms), (D due 0ms), (E due 100ms)
//! then the actual order of execution is B, D, A, E, C.
