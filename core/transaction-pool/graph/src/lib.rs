//! Generic Transaction Pool
//!
//! The pool is based on dependency graph between transactions
//! and their priority.
//! The pool is able to return an iterator that traverses transaction
//! graph in the correct order taking into account priorities and dependencies.
//!
//! TODO [ToDr]
//! - [ ] Multi-threading (getting ready transactions should not block the pool)
