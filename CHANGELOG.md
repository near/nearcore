## 1.26.0 [2022-05-18]

### Protocol Changes

### Non-protocol Changes

* Switch to LZ4+ZSTD compression from Snappy in RocksDB [#6365](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6365)

* Use kebab-case names for neard subcommands to make them consistent with flag names.  snake_case names are still valid for existing subcommands but kebab-case will be used for new commands.

## 1.25.0 [2022-03-16]

### Protocol Changes
* `max_gas_burnt` has been increased to 300.

### Non-protocol Changes
* More Prometheus metrics related to epoch, sync state, node version, chunk fullness and missing chunks have been added.
* Progress bar is now displayed when downloading `config.json` and `genesis.json`.
* Status line printed in logs by `neard` is now more descriptive.
- `view_state` is now a command of `neard`; `state-viewer` is no longer a separate binary.
- `RUST_LOG` environment variable is now correctly respected.
- `NetworkConfig::verify` will now fail if configuration is invalid rather than printing error and continuing.
- Fixed a minor bug which resulted in DB Not Found errors when requesting chunks.
- Updated to wasmer-near 2.2.0 which fixes a potential crash and improves cost estimator working.
- `neard init` will no longer override node or validator private keys.
- Rosetta RPC now populates `related_transactions` field.
- Rosetta RPC support is now compiled in by default. The feature still needs to be explicitly turned on and is experimental.
- Rosetta RPC /network/status end point correctly works on non-archival nodes.
- `unsafe_reset_all` and `unsafe_reset_data` commands are now deprecated. Use `rm` explicitly instead.

* Enable access key nonce range for implicit accounts to prevent tx hash collisions.
* Upgraded our version of pwasm-utils to 0.18 -- the old one severely undercounted stack usage in some cases.

### Non-protocol Changes

* Fix a bug in chunk requesting where validator might request chunks even if parent block hasn’t been processed yet.
