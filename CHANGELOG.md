# Changelog

## [unreleased]

### Protocol Changes

* Stabilize `account_id_in_function_call_permission` feature: enforcing validity
  of account ids in function call permission.

### Non-protocol Changes

* `use_db_migration_snapshot` and `db_migration_snapshot_path` options are now
  deprecated.  If they are set in `config.json` the node will fail if migration
  needs to be performed.  Use `store.migration_snapshot` instead to configure
  the behaviour [#7486](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7486)
* `network.external_address` field in `config.json` file is
  deprecated.  In fact it has never been used and only served to
  confuse everyone [#7300](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7300)
* Due to increasing state size, improved shard cache for Trie nodes to
  put more nodes in memory. Requires 3 GB more RAM
  [#7429](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7429)
* Added `near_peer_message_sent_by_type_bytes` and
  `near_peer_message_sent_by_type_total` Prometheus metrics measuring
  size and number of messages sent to peers.
* `near_peer_message_received_total` Prometheus metric is now deprecated.
  Instead of it aggregate `near_peer_message_received_by_type_total` metric.
  For example, to get total rate of received messages use
  `sum(rate(near_peer_message_received_by_type_total{...}[5m]))`.
* Few changes to `view_state` JSON RPC query:
  - The requset has now an optional `include_proof` argument.  When set to
    `true`, response’s `proof` will be populated.
  - The `proof` within each value in `values` list of a `view_state` response is
    now deprecated and will be removed in the future.  Client code should ignore
    the field.
  - The `proof` field directly within `view_state` response is currently always
    sent even if proof has not been requested.  In the future the field will be
    skipped in those cases.  Clients should accept responses with this field
    missing (unless they set `include_proof`).
* Backtraces on panics are enabled by default, so you no longer need to set
  `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environmental variable. To disable backtraces, set
  `RUST_BACKTRACE=0`.
* A `[path, data]` JSON RPC query format has been removed.  It has been
  deprecated for over two years and not documented anywhere.  Use proper
  structured queries with `rquest_type` set instead.
* Enable receipt prefetching by default. This feature makes receipt processing
  faster by parallelizing IO requests, which has been introduced in
  [#7590](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7590) and enabled by default
  with [#7661](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7661).
  Configurable in `config.json` using `store.enable_receipt_prefetching`.

## 1.28.0 [2022-07-27]

### Protocol Changes

* Stabilized `alt_bn128_g1_multiexp`, `alt_bn128_g1_sum`, `alt_bn128_pairing_check` host functions [#6813](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6813).

### Non-protocol Changes

* Added `path` option to `StoreConfig` which makes location to the
  RocksDB configurable via `config.json` file (at `store.path` path)
  rather than being hard-coded to `data` directory in neard home
  directory [#6938](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6938)
* Removed `testnet` alias for `localnet` command; it’s been deprecated
  since 1.24 [#7033](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7033)
* Removed undocumented `unsafe_reset_all` and `unsafe_reset_data`
  commands; they were deprecated since 1.25
* Key files can use `private_key` field instead of `secret_key` now;
  this improves interoperability with near cli which uses the former
  name [#7030](https://github.com/near/nearcore/issues/7030)
* Latency of network messages is now measured
  [#7050](https://github.com/near/nearcore/issues/7050)

## 1.25.0 [2022-03-16]

### Protocol Changes
* `max_gas_burnt` has been increased to 300.

### Non-protocol Changes
* More Prometheus metrics related to epoch, sync state, node version, chunk fullness and missing chunks have been added.
* Progress bar is now displayed when downloading `config.json` and `genesis.json`.
* Status line printed in logs by `neard` is now more descriptive.
- `view_state` is now a command of `neard`; `state-viewer` is no longer a separate binary.
- `RUST_LOG` environment variable is now correctly respected.
- `NetworkConfig::verify` will now fail if configuration is invalid rather than printing error and continuing.
- Fixed a minor bug which resulted in DB Not Found errors when requesting chunks.
- Updated to wasmer-near 2.2.0 which fixes a potential crash and improves cost estimator working.
- `neard init` will no longer override node or validator private keys.
- Rosetta RPC now populates `related_transactions` field.
- Rosetta RPC support is now compiled in by default. The feature still needs to be explicitly turned on and is experimental.
- Rosetta RPC /network/status end point correctly works on non-archival nodes.
- `unsafe_reset_all` and `unsafe_reset_data` commands are now deprecated. Use `rm` explicitly instead.
