* ‚öñÔ∏è NEAR Protocol is a new smart-contract platform that delivers scalability and usability.
* üõ† Through sharding, it will linearly scale with the number of validation nodes on the network.
* üóù Leveraging WebAssembly, TypeScript, more sane contract management, ephemeral accounts and many other advancements, NEAR
finally makes using a blockchain protocol easy for both developers and consumers.

## Quick start

[Check out our documentation](http://docs.nearprotocol.com), specifically:
 - [Working with Smart Contracts in NEAR Studio](https://docs.nearprotocol.com/docs/quick-start/development-overview)

Develop and deploy contracts without any setup required using [NEAR Studio](https://studio.nearprotocol.com):
