## About NEAR

NEAR's purpose is to enable community-driven innovation to benefit people around the world.

To achieve this purpose, *NEAR* provides a developer platform where developers and entrepreneurs can create apps that put users back in control of their data and assets, which is the foundation of ["Open Web" movement][open-web-url].

One of the components of *NEAR* is the NEAR Protocol, an infrastructure for server-less applications and smart contracts powered by a blockchain.
NEAR Protocol is built to deliver usability and scalability of modern PaaS like Firebase at fraction of the prices that blockchains like Ethereum charge.

Overall, *NEAR* provides a wide range of tools for developers to easily build applications:
 - [JS Client library][js-api] to connect to NEAR Protocol from your applications.
 - [Rust][rust-sdk] and [AssemblyScript][as-sdk] SDKs to write smart contracts and stateful server-less functions.
 - [Numerous examples][examples-url] with links to hack on them right inside your browser.
 - [Lots of documentation][docs-url], with [Tutorials][tutorials-url] and [API docs][api-docs-url].

## Join the Network

The easiest way to join the network, is by using the `nearup` command, which you can install as follows:

```bash
pip3 install --user nearup
```

You can join all the active networks:
* mainnet: `nearup run mainnet`
* testnet: `nearup run testnet`
* betanet: `nearup run betanet`

Check the `nearup` repository for [more details](https://github.com/near/nearup) on how to run with or without docker.

To learn how to become validator, checkout [documentation](https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/node/validator/staking-and-delegation).
