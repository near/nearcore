* ⚖️ NEAR Protocol is a new smart-contract platform that delivers scalability and usability.
* 🛠 Through sharding, it will linearly scale with the number of validation nodes on the network.
* 🗝 Leveraging WebAssembly, TypeScript, more sane contract management, ephemeral accounts and many other advancements, NEAR
finally makes using a blockchain protocol easy for both developers and consumers.

## Quick start
