* ‚öñÔ∏è NEAR Protocol is a new smart-contract platform that delivers scalability and usability.
* üõ† Through sharding, it will linearly scale with the number of validation nodes on the network.
* üóù Leveraging WebAssembly, TypeScript, more sane contract management, ephemeral accounts and many other advancements, NEAR
finally makes using a blockchain protocol easy for both developers and consumers.
