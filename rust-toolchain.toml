[toolchain]
# This specifies the version of Rust we use to build.
# Individual crates in the workspace may support a lower version, as indicated by `rust-version` field in each crate's `Cargo.toml`.
# The version specified below, should be at least as high as the maximum `rust-version` within the workspace.

# XXX: Do not bump this version yet.  1.87 adds supports for bulk memory in wasm
# and we do not support contracts with bulk memory yet.  Increasing the version
# number here will make it harder for contract developers to build and test
# their contracts.  See
# https://near.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/295306-contract-runtime/topic/bulk.20memory.20support
# for more details.
