# This specifies the version of Rust we use to build.
# Individual crates in the workspace may support a lower version, as indicated by `rust-version` field in each crate's `Cargo.toml`.
# The version specified below, should be at least as high as the maximum `rust-version` within the workspace.

# Bumped from 1.86.0 to 1.88.0 to fix RUSTSEC-2026-0009 (time crate DoS via
# stack exhaustion).  time >=0.3.47 requires rustc 1.88.
# Note: 1.87+ adds bulk memory support for wasm.  See
