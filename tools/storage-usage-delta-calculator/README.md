# Storage delta calculator

A small tool to compare the actual storage use with the one saved within the state.
Useful as a sanity check if we do any updates (as storage has impact on the amount of tokens that we lock in people's accounts).

WARNING: This was built as a one-time tool - to debug the issue during migration in May 2021 - and is no longer maintained.
