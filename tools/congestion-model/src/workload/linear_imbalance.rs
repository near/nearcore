/// linear progression of how busy each shard is. Shard 1 only processes 1
/// receipt per round. Shard 2 processes 2 and so on. With enough shards, we get
/// many different levels of congestion and we get to see how many shards are
/// still able to function undisturbed.
///
/// The work intensity is scaled such that half the shard are below max capacity
/// and half are above (forced to be congested). And the busiest shard (highest
/// shard id) receives twice its capacity.
///

///
///     receipts_per_round(shard_id) =
///         2 * (shard_id + 1) * (GAS_LIMIT / GAS_PER_RECEIPT) / NUM_SHARDS
