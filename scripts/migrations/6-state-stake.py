"""
This migration implements state staking spec change:
https://github.com/nearprotocol/NEPs/pull/41

Full discussion can be found:
https://github.com/nearprotocol/NEPs/issues/40

Changes:
 - Replace `storage_cost_byte_per_block` with `storage_amount_per_byte` for state staking.
 - Remove `account_length_baseline_cost_per_block` as we don't charge for account names anymore.
 - Remove `storage_paid_at` in Account as we now don't need to maintain virtual balances.
 - Update balances to make sure that they are over balance requirements.
