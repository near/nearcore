"""Checks whether all expensive tests are mentioned in NayDuck tests list

Scans all Rust source files looking for expensive tests and than makes sure that
they are all referenced in NayDuck test list files (the nightly/*.txt files).
Returns with success if that's the case; with failure otherwise.

An expensive test is one which beings with the `ultra_slow_test_` prefix:

    #[test]
    fn ultra_slow_test_gc_random_large() {
        test_gc_random_common(25);
    }

Expensive tests are not executed when running `cargo test` nor are they run in
CI and it's the purpose of this script to make sure that they are listed for
NayDuck to run.
