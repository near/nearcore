# How to use

## Run the benchmark
- compile the `neard` with the `tx_generator` feature
```
cargo build --release --features tx_generator
```
- create a link to the release binary of neard in the `benchmarks/transactions-generator`
```
cd benchmarks/transactions-generator && ln -s ../../release/neard ./
```
- run the thing
```
just do_it 20000
```
The last command will init a single-node network, apply customizations to the config, create the accounts and run the benchmark.
All of it.
For a more fine-grained control feel free to dive into the `justfile` for the commands executing the intermediate steps.

## What you should see
