-- Granting individual permissions like done previously is tedious and error
-- prone. In addition it must be repeated for all new tables.
-- The benchmarks db contains no sensitive data, so we can use
-- `pg_read_all_data` and `pg_write_all_data` to simplify things. These
-- permissions automatically apply to new tables added in the future.
