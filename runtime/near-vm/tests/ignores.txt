## WASI

### These tests don't pass due to race conditions in the new way we run tests.
### It's not built to be run in parallel with itself, so we disable it for now.

wasitests::snapshot1::host_fs::writing
wasitests::unstable::host_fs::writing
wasitests::snapshot1::mem_fs::writing
wasitests::unstable::mem_fs::writing

### due to hard-coded direct calls into WASI for wasi unstable

wasitests::snapshot1::host_fs::fd_read
wasitests::snapshot1::host_fs::poll_oneoff
wasitests::snapshot1::host_fs::fd_pread
wasitests::snapshot1::host_fs::fd_close
wasitests::snapshot1::host_fs::fd_allocate
wasitests::snapshot1::host_fs::close_preopen_fd

wasitests::snapshot1::mem_fs::fd_allocate
wasitests::snapshot1::mem_fs::close_preopen_fd
wasitests::snapshot1::mem_fs::envvar

### TODO: resolve the disabled tests below. These are newly disabled tests from the migration:

### due to git clone not preserving symlinks:
wasitests::snapshot1::host_fs::readlink
wasitests::unstable::host_fs::readlink
wasitests::snapshot1::mem_fs::readlink
wasitests::unstable::mem_fs::readlink

### failing due to `remove_dir_all`. this test is also bad for parallelism
wasitests::snapshot1::host_fs::create_dir
wasitests::unstable::host_fs::create_dir
wasitests::snapshot1::mem_fs::create_dir
wasitests::unstable::mem_fs::create_dir

### failing because it closes `stdout` which breaks our testing system
wasitests::unstable::host_fs::fd_close
wasitests::unstable::mem_fs::fd_close

### failing because we're operating on stdout which is now overridden.
### TODO: check WasiFile implementation
### Alterative: split test into 2 parts, one printing to stderr, the other printing to stdout to test the real versions
wasitests::unstable::host_fs::poll_oneoff
wasitests::unstable::mem_fs::poll_oneoff

### randomly failed, mainly on windows but also on macos, due to a race condition when concurently testing multiple compiler / engines
wasitests::snapshot1::host_fs::fd_rename_path
