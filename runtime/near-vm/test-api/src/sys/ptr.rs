//! Types for a reusable pointer abstraction for accessing Wasm linear memory.
//!
//! This abstraction is safe: it ensures the memory is in bounds and that the pointer
//! is aligned (avoiding undefined behavior).
//!
//! Therefore, you should use this abstraction whenever possible to avoid memory
//! related bugs when implementing an ABI.
