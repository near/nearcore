# Runtime Parameters Estimator

Use this tool to measure the runnning time of elementary runtime operations that have associated fees.

1. Follow `genesis-toosl/genesis-populate` instructions to generate the state dump (you can use 100000 accounts if you are experimenting only);
2. Place generated files into `/tmp/data` and run this tool.

Note, you would need to install [gnuplot](http://gnuplot.info/) to see the graphs.
