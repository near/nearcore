# near-vm-runner-standalone

A command line wrapper around `near-vm-runner.`
All error messages that can be raised during the contract execution are raised by `near-vm-runner`
and the all effects of computing the execution result of a smart contract are encapsulated inside `near-vm-runner`.

One can use `near-vm-runner-standalone` to test the smart contracts, e.g. with integration tests
to make sure it has expected behavior once deployed to the blockchain.

To use run like this:

   cargo run -- --wasm-file ./status_message.wasm --method-name set_status --input '{"message": "12345"}'
   —Åargo run -- --wasm-file ./status_message.wasm --method-name get_status --input '{"account_id": "bob"}' --state '{"U1RBVEU=":"AQAAAAMAAABib2IFAAAAMTIzNDU="}'

I.e. persistent state could be passed across runs via `--state` parameter.
